This project is based on the chrome content shell, which can simply replace Android System WebView, 
but it is not comprehensive. 

For example, it does not support file selectors because the Chromium project did not implement them(shell_app_delegate.cc).


It's base on  https://github.com/chromium/chromium/tree/123.0.6312.121







If you want to run the project, you need to download the dependencies to the specified directory in the release. Then run him again.
